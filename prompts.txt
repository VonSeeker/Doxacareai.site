Create a web-based healthcare assistant application called EvaCare AI, designed for Sierra Leone, to provide specialized health diagnoses and sustainable health advice for African communities. The app should have a user-friendly, mobile-optimized interface with a professional, empathetic, and culturally sensitive design, reflecting Sierra Leone’s context (e.g., vibrant greens and yellows inspired by the national flag). Include the following features:  Chat Interface: A text input box where users can enter health queries (e.g., 'I have a fever and headache' or 'How to prevent malaria?'). Display responses in a conversational format, with clear, concise, and accessible language. Support intents like: symptom_checker: Analyze symptoms (e.g., 'fever, headache') and suggest possible conditions (e.g., 'This could be malaria, consult a doctor'). health_advice: Provide sustainable health tips (e.g., 'Use mosquito nets to prevent malaria'). local_resources: List nearby clinics or health services in Sierra Leone (e.g., 'Visit Connaught Hospital in Freetown'). emergency_alert: Escalate urgent cases (e.g., 'I’m having trouble breathing' → 'Call 117 or visit a clinic immediately'). Include quick-reply buttons for common actions (e.g., 'Describe more symptoms', 'Find a clinic'). Cultural and Linguistic Features: Support English and Krio (Sierra Leone’s lingua franca) with a toggle for language selection. Display key advice in Krio for accessibility (e.g., 'Foh stop malaria, use mosquito net wey get medicine'). Use culturally relevant imagery (e.g., local healthcare settings, Sierra Leonean landscapes). Real-Time Health Data: Integrate a section for health alerts (e.g., malaria outbreaks) by connecting to APIs from WHO or Sierra Leone’s Ministry of Health. Show a map or list of local clinics based on user location (if available). Accessibility: Optimize for low-bandwidth environments, ensuring fast loading on mobile devices with limited internet. Include an offline mode with preloaded health tips (e.g., malaria prevention, maternal health advice). Offer SMS integration (via Twilio API) for users without smartphones to receive responses. Backend Integration: Use Hugging Face’s DeepSeek V3 model for generating accurate, context-aware health responses. Connect to a fine-tuned LLM (e.g., T5 or BLOOM) trained on healthcare data for Sierra Leone, ensuring responses align with WHO guidelines. Include a mechanism to escalate complex queries to human healthcare professionals via email or local emergency contacts. Design Requirements: A clean, intuitive layout with a header (EvaCare AI logo), a chat window, and a footer with links to health resources (e.g., WHO, Sierra Leone Ministry of Health). Real-time preview of user inputs and responses, with a loading animation during processing. Buttons for navigation (e.g., 'Home', 'Health Tips', 'Find Clinics'). Privacy and Safety: Ensure user data (e.g., symptoms) is anonymized and complies with Sierra Leone’s data protection regulations. Display a disclaimer: 'EvaCare AI provides general advice. Consult a doctor for medical emergencies.' Generate the app with all code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and deploy it on Hugging Face Spaces for free. Provide a link to the live app and a gallery of screenshots showcasing the chat interface, Krio support, and health alerts."

go back to old versions
redo
make the important links workable to their correct directory
under symptom checker, when giving recommended actions , make find nearest clinic based on user location, and make more about these conditions workable with precise details
under symptom checker, when giving recommended actions , make find nearest clinic based on user location, and make more about these conditions workable with precise details
give detailed description of conditions under symptom checker(conditions details)
make the chat bot be accessible to more health question like physical exercise etc
remove condition details under recommended actions
under health topics give precise and correct symptoms for what is ask for
under health topics, make sure user can refresh health topics feed when they are done or want to navigate further
under home; make "chat with evacare ai" be more responsive to physical health issue, and also give holistic recommendations or home remedy 
in home; change from "quick links' to " Quick Chats"
make health advice section into more forum discusing different health advice 
create a sign in page that allows user to create an account or create an account and login with facebook, google
Enhance the Eva-Care AI web application (a healthcare assistant for Sierra Leone) by implementing a user authentication system that displays a login modal upon page load, requiring users to either log in or sign up before accessing the app. The system should support email/password authentication and social login via Facebook and Google, maintaining the app’s existing Tailwind CSS styling and seamless integration with its current features.  Current Codebase:  The app is a single-page HTML application hosted on Hugging Face Spaces (https://huggingface.co/spaces/vonSeeker/eva-care). It uses Tailwind CSS for styling, Font Awesome for icons, and vanilla JavaScript for interactivity. The app has an "Account" tab with mock sign-in and sign-up forms, including placeholders for Facebook and Google login buttons. The modal should integrate with the existing UI (green/yellow color scheme, Poppins font) and support Krio/English language toggling. Requirements:  Login Modal on Page Load: Display a modal when the app loads, preventing access to the main content until the user logs in or signs up. The modal should include tabs for "Sign In" and "Sign Up," matching the existing Account tab’s design. Include options for email/password login, email/password sign-up, and social login via Facebook and Google. Authentication Features: Email/Password Login: Validate credentials against a backend service. Display error messages for invalid credentials. Email/Password Sign-Up: Allow users to create an account with name, email, password, and password confirmation. Validate inputs (e.g., matching passwords, valid email format) and store securely in a backend. Social Login: Implement OAuth 2.0 for Facebook and Google login, redirecting users to the respective providers and handling callback tokens. After successful login, hide the modal, store the session (e.g., via JWT or session token), and allow access to the app. Backend Integration: Recommend a backend solution (e.g., Firebase Authentication, Supabase, or a custom Node.js/Express server) to handle user authentication, storage, and session management. Ensure secure storage of user data (e.g., hashed passwords) and compliance with GDPR for health-related data. Provide API endpoints for sign-up, login, and social login callbacks. UI/UX: Use Tailwind CSS to style the modal consistently with the app’s design (green-600, yellow-400, white, rounded corners, shadow effects). Include a "Close" button to dismiss the modal after login, and a "Forgot Password" link for email-based password reset. Ensure the modal is responsive and accessible (e.g., keyboard navigation, screen reader support). Support Krio/English toggling in the modal, using the existing isEnglish variable and translation logic. Security: Implement CSRF protection for forms. Use HTTPS for all API calls. Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent XSS or SQL injection. Store JWT or session tokens securely (e.g., in HttpOnly cookies or localStorage with proper safeguards). Integration with Existing Code: Modify the existing account-tab to redirect logged-in users to a profile view (e.g., showing user details, logout option). Update the JavaScript to check authentication status on page load and prevent modal re-display for logged-in users. Ensure social login buttons in the current Account tab are functional and consistent with the modal. Testing: Provide unit tests for authentication logic (e.g., using pytest for backend, Jest for frontend if applicable). Test edge cases: invalid email, mismatched passwords, failed social login, session expiration. Ensure compatibility with Hugging Face Spaces’ environment (Python-based, limited resources). Deliverables: Updated HTML with the login modal code. JavaScript for modal display, form handling, and OAuth integration. Backend setup instructions (e.g., Firebase configuration or Node.js server code). Sample API endpoints for authentication. Unit tests for critical authentication paths. Documentation for deploying the updated app on Hugging Face Spaces. Constraints:  Minimize external dependencies to keep deployment simple on Hugging Face Spaces. Ensure the solution works within the existing vanilla JavaScript setup (no frameworks like React unless necessary). Maintain performance for low-bandwidth users in Sierra Leone. Ensure the modal is non-intrusive for returning users with active sessions.
